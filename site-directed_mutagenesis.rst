HOMEWORK - SIMPLY DESCRIBE SDM
==============================

Site-directed mutagenesis (*SDM*) is a method to create
specific,targeted changes in double stranded DNA. There
are may reasons to do those specific alterations,like:
* study changes in protein activity
* select or screen for mutations that have desired
property
* introduce or remove restriction sites

Basic mechanism
---------------
#. The first step is to synthetize short DNA primer
   that contains the desired mutation and yet is
   complementary to the template DNA aroud the mutated
   site.
#. Indroduced mutation might be a single base change
   (*point mutation*), multiple base changes,
   *deletion*, *insertion*.
#. After the hybridization primier containing desired
   mutation is the extended using a DNA polymerase,
   which copies rest of the gene. Thus copied gene
   contains the mutated site and rest of the gene in
   intact form.
#. The mutated gene is then introduced into host cell
   and cloned.
#. Mutants carrying the mutation are selected, perhaps
   using DNA sequencing technique.

Limitations and other approaches
--------------------------------
Original method using single-primer extension was
inefficient (*low yield of mutants*), this was due to
for example fact that templated used was methylated
while mutand strand was not which migt lead to
counter-selection of mutants due to mismatch repair
system that facours the methylated DNA. One example of more advanced SMD method is PCR site-directed 
mutagenesis.

Now day's a large number of methods are avaible to
effect site-directed mutagenesis, but most of them are
rarely used in fact since there are newer techniques
that allow for easier waus of introducing site specific
mutations.
